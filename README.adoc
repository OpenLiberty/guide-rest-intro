== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and test a simple REST service with JAX-RS and JSON-B, which will expose
the JVM's system properties. The REST service will respond to `GET` requests made to the `\http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties` URL.

The service responds to a `GET` request with a JSON representation of the system properties, where
each property is a field in a JSON object like this:

[source,json,role="no_copy"]
----
{
  "os.name":"Mac",
  "java.version": "1.8"
}
----

The design of an HTTP API is essential when creating a web application. The REST API has 
become the go-to architectural style for building an HTTP API. The JAX-RS API offers 
functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting exposed resources. The JAX-RS API 
supports the creation of RESTful web services that come with desirable properties, 
such as performance, scalability, and modifiability.

== Creating a JAX-RS application

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/devmode-lmp33-start.adoc[]

JAX-RS has two key concepts for creating REST APIs. The most obvious one is the resource itself, which is
modelled as a class. The second is a JAX-RS application, which groups all exposed resources under a
common path. You can think of the JAX-RS application as a wrapper for all of your resources.

#Replace the `SystemApplication` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/SystemApplication.java`
----

The [hotspot=systemApplication]`SystemApplication` class extends the `Application` class, which associates all JAX-RS resource classes in the WAR file with this JAX-RS application. These resources become available under the common path that's specified with the [hotspot=applicationPath]`@ApplicationPath` 
annotation. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation has a value that indicates the path in the WAR file that 
the JAX-RS application accepts requests from.

// Creating the JAX-RS resource
// =================================================================================================

== Creating the JAX-RS resource

In JAX-RS, a single class should represent a single resource, or a group of resources of the same type.
In this application, a resource might be a system property, or a set of system properties. It is easy
to have a single class handle multiple different resources, but keeping a clean separation between types
of resources helps with maintainability in the long run.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `PropertiesResource` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/PropertiesResource.java`
----

This resource class has quite a bit of code in it, so let's break it down into manageable chunks.

The [hotspot=path file=0]`@Path` annotation on the class indicates that this resource responds to the `properties` path
in the JAX-RS application. The [hotspot=applicationPath file=1]`@ApplicationPath` annotation in the [hotspot=systemApplication file=1]`SystemApplication` class together with
the [hotspot=path file=0]`@Path` annotation in this class indicates that the resource is available at the `system/properties`
path.

JAX-RS maps the HTTP methods on the URL to the methods of the class by using annotations. 
Your application uses the [hotspot=get]`GET` annotation to map an HTTP `GET` request
to the `system/properties` path.

The [hotspot=get file=0]`@GET` annotation on the method indicates that this method is to be called for the HTTP `GET`
method. The [hotspot=produces file=0]`@Produces` annotation indicates the format of the content that will be returned. The
value of the [hotspot=produces file=0]`@Produces` annotation will be specified in the HTTP `Content-Type` response header.
For this application, a JSON structure is to be returned. The desired `Content-Type` for a JSON
response is `application/json` with `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON` instead of the `String` content type. Using a constant such as `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON` is better because if there's a spelling error, a compile failure occurs.

JAX-RS supports a number of ways to marshal JSON. The JAX-RS 2.1 specification mandates JSON-Binding
(JSON-B). The method body returns the result of `System.getProperties()`, which is of type `java.util.Properties`. Since the method 
is annotated with `@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)`, JAX-RS uses JSON-B to automatically convert the returned object
to JSON data in the HTTP response.

// =================================================================================================
// Configuring the server
// =================================================================================================

== Configuring the server

To get the service running, the Liberty server needs to be correctly configured.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the server configuration file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

server.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The configuration does the following actions:

* Configures the server to enable JAX-RS. This is specified in the [hotspot=featureManager file=0]`featureManager` element.
* Configures the server to resolve the HTTP port numbers from variables, which are then specified in the Maven [hotspot=defaultHttpPort hotspot=defaultHttpsPort file=1]`pom.xml` file. This is specified in the [hotspot=httpEndpoint file=0]`httpEndpoint` element. Variables use the `${variableName}` syntax.
* Configures the server to run the produced web application on a context root specified in the [hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`pom.xml` file. This is specified in the [hotspot=webApplication file=0]`webApplication` element.

pom.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

The variables that are being used in the [hotspot=httpEndpoint hotspot=webApplication file=0]`server.xml` file are provided by the properties set in the Maven [hotspot=defaultHttpPort hotspot=defaultHttpsPort hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`pom.xml` file. The properties must be formatted as `liberty.var.variableName`.

// =================================================================================================

Check out the service that you created at the http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties[^] URL.

// =================================================================================================

== Testing the service

// static guide instructions:
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
You can test this service manually by starting a server and pointing a web browser at the
http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties[^] URL. However, automated tests are a 
much better approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug. JUnit and the JAX-RS 
Client API provide a simple environment to test the application.

// cloud-hosted guide instructions:
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
You can test this service manually by starting a server and visiting the
http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/system/properties URL. However, automated tests are a 
much better approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug. JUnit and the JAX-RS 
Client API provide a simple environment to test the application.
endif::[]

You can write tests for the individual units of code outside of a running application server, or they
can be written to call the application server directly. In this example, you will create a test that
does the latter.

#Create the `EndpointIT` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java`
----

EndpointIT.java
[source, Java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java[]
----

This test class has more lines of code than the resource implementation. This situation is common.
The test method is indicated with the [hotspot=test file=0]`@Test` annotation.

pom.xml
[source , xml, linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

The test code needs to know some information about the application to make requests. The server port and the application context root are key, and are dictated by the server configuration. While this information can be hardcoded, it is better to specify it in a single place like the Maven [hotspot=defaultHttpPort hotspot=defaultHttpsPort hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`pom.xml` file. Refer to the [hotspot file=1]`pom.xml` file to see how the application information such as the [hotspot=defaultHttpPort file=1]`default.http.port`, [hotspot=defaultHttpsPort file=1]`default.https.port` and [hotspot=appContextRoot file=1]`app.context.root` elements are provided in the file.


These Maven properties are then passed to the Java test program as the [hotspot=testsysprops file=1]`systemPropertyVariables` element in the [hotspot file=1]`pom.xml` file.

Getting the values to create a representation of the URL is simple. The test class uses the [hotspot=systemProperties file=0]`getProperty` method
to get the application details.

To call the JAX-RS service using the JAX-RS client, first create a `WebTarget` object by calling
the [hotspot=target file=0]`target` method that provides the URL. To cause the HTTP request to occur, the [hotspot=requestget file=0]`request().get()` method
is called on the `WebTarget` object. The [hotspot=requestget file=0]`get` method
call is a synchronous call that blocks until a response is received. This call returns a [hotspot=requestget file=0]`Response`
object, which can be inspected to determine whether the request was successful.

The first thing to check is that a `200` response was received. The JUnit [hotspot=assertequals file=0]`assertEquals` method can be used for this check.

Check the response body to ensure it returned the right information. Since the client and the server
are running on the same machine, it is reasonable to expect that the system properties for the local
and remote JVM would be the same. In this case, an [hotspot=assertosname file=0]`assertEquals` assertion is made so that the `os.name` system property
for both JVMs is the same. You can write additional assertions to check for more values.

You will see the following output:

[source,role="no_copy"]
----
-------------------------------------------------------

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

To see whether the tests detect a failure, add an assertion that you know fails, or change the existing
assertion to a constant value that doesn't match the `os.name` system property.
